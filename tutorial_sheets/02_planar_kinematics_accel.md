# Tutorial Sheet 2: Planar Kinematics with Acceleration 

**Topics covered are**
- Acceleration in 2D 
- Relative accelerations

**Tips**
- The questions start tp get quite wordy. Drawing it all out helps!
- Because we are dealing with 2D planar motion, it does not matter which relative acceleration formula we use - the one using $\omega\times\omega$ or $\omega^2$. When expanding to 3D, only $\omega\times\omega$ works, but for the moment $\omega^2$ is faster. 

<br>

## Question 1 

The rigid body rotates about the z axis with counterclockwise angular velocity ω = 4 rad/s and counterclockwise angular acceleration α = 2 rad/s $^2$. The distance $r_{A/B}$ = 0.6m.  

**(a)** What are the rigid body’s angular velocity and angular acceleration vectors? <br> 
**(b)** Determine the acceleration of point A relative to point B.

## Question 2

The helicopter is in planar motion in the xy plane. At the instant shown, the position of its center of mass G is x=2 m, y=2.5 m, its velocity is $v_G$ = 12i + 4j m/s, and its acceleration is $a_G$ = 2i + 3j m/s $^2$. The position of point T where the tail rotor is mounted is x=-3.5 m, y=4.5 m. The helicopter’s angular velocity is 0.2 rad/s clockwise, and its angular acceleration is 0.1 rad/s $^2$ counter-clockwise.

What is the acceleration of point T?

## Question 3

The bar rotates with a counterclockwise angular velocity of 5 rad/s and a counterclockwise angular acceleration of 30 rad/s $^2$. Determine the acceleration of A using $ a_{A}=a_B+\alpha\times r_{A/B}+\omega\times(\omega\times r_{A/B}) $.

## Question 4

If $\omega_{AB}$=2rad/s, $\alpha_{AB}$=2rad/s $^2$, $\omega_{BC}$=−1rad/s, and $\alpha_{BC}$=−4rad/s $^2$, what is the acceleration of point C where the scoop of the excavator is attached?

## Question 5

The length of the bar is L = 4 m and the angle $\theta$ = 30°. The bar’s angular velocity is $\omega$ = 1.8 rad/s and its angular acceleration is $\alpha$ = 6 rad/s $^2$. The endpoints of the bar slide on the plane surfaces. Determine the acceleration of the midpoint G.
